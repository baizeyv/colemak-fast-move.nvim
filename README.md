This plugin accelerates the movement of the `neui` keys. It also works in vscode-neovim.(COLEMAK)

## Installation

`baizeyv/fast-cursor-move.nvim`

## Usage

- No configuration is required.
- Make sure the plugin is installed and loaded.

I believe that the default behavior of the plugin will satisfy most users :)

## Options

- `vim.g.fast_cursor_move_acceleration` Set it to false to disable the acceleration behaviour.
